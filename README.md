# Cloud-Native Case Study

### Overview
```
Contoso is a leading retail e-commerce company for families in Europe, with plans to accelerate the 
development of new products and services worldwide. “Our technology platform must be a business enabler. 
That starts by removing limiting factors,” said the Director of Architecture & Technology. 
```

### Existing Environment
```
* 25 backend microservices for the company's mobile apps hosted on standalone Linux virtual machines

* 3 SQL servers hosted on Windows virtual machines

* 1 IBM application gateway

* It took up to 2 weeks to provision a new infrastructure environment as the entire process was manual 
and based on demand approvals
```


### Planned Changes
```
* After a few months of experimentation, the platform team decided to use Kubernetes as its orchestration platform. 

* Shift focus from provisioning and configuring infrastructure environments to building services.

* The company required complementary technologies to handle non-functional requirements such as automated deployments, 
security, monitoring, and recovery.

* The choices of technology matched the cloud-native and multi-cloud requirements essential to the transformation 
of application delivery.
